# .NET

## 👀 TLDR;

[.NET](https://dot.net) is a framework for writing _any_ type of application, including, but not limited to, console apps, mobile apps (with MAUI) web APIs (with ASP.NET Core), games (with Unity3D) and machine learning models (with ML.NET).

It features a rich standard library which covers most of the use cases. For everything else there's NuGet - .NET's dependency manager and package repository with over 300k unique packages to choose from.

## ➕ Benefits

* You can write code on any platform (with Visual Studio on Windows, JetBrains Rider and VS Code on Windows, Mac and Linux)
* You can run code on any platform
* ...even in the browser via WebAssembly
* .NET is open-source
* You can use C#, F#, VB.NET or any [other supported language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_CLI_languages)
* ...realistically though, use C#

## ➖ When not to use

* When you hate Microsoft with passion and cannot bear the thought of using anything they made
