# Event Storming

## 👀 TLDR;

Event Storming is a technique used to explore complex business domains. It's hosted as a collaborative workshop with a specific goal in mind. Technique can be adjusted to any team or problem, but there are the main types of sessions:

1. Big Picture - understand big picture of the domain and problem
2. Process Level - model processes
3. Design Level - design the technical implementation

The most common Big Picture Session has following steps:

1. Kick-off - Give an introduction to the technique and describe workshop goal
2. Chaotic exploration - Generate events, which are meaningful
3. Enforce the timeline - Add timeline and remove duplicates
4. People and systems - Find sources of events and external integrations
5. Problem and opportunities - Validate the result, you could go through the process in reverse
