# Serverless

## Implementation

Serverless in the MVP phase allows you to create and implement an API to the project quickly and with little effort. The pay-as-you-go model will also work well here as startup MVP projects often do not have a fixed source of funding or are testing a new business model

Serverless in the Scalup phase has the same benefits as in the MVP phase (implementation speed and payment for actual consumption), but also offers very good scaling. Serverless works best in event systems and as a facade for receiving data or requests

In the case of very large, continuous traffic, solutions based on e.g. k8s may turn out to be a better solution. Another disadvantage of serverless is the delayed start time of functions, which can be crucial for some projects
