# Microservices Architecture

## Reasons to move from Product Market Fit to Scaling
- Great to use when you are not only scaling the solution / product but also team,
- Sometimes it's better to start with Modular Monolith architecture first, before jumping into Micro-services,
- In Product Market Fit you are focusing on paying Technical Debt, refactoring code and improving solution. Micro-services introduces complexity that might influence the focus on those things.
