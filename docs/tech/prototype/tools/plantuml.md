# PlantUML

## What is PlantUML?

[PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/) is a tool for creating diagrams as code. The supported diagram types range from sequence and activity diagrams to describe the event flow in the system to component and deployment diagrams which can be used to visualize the architecture with a desired level of detail.

## ➕ Benefits

* Ability to version-control the diagrams in a human-readable way
* Installation is optional - you can use the [online server](https://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/) to render your diagrams
* ...but there's also a convenient [VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jebbs.plantuml)
* GitLab supports embedding PlantUML diagrams in the markdown docs
* Extensibility - you can define your own macros and use the ones provided by the community, for instance [C4-PlantUML](https://github.com/plantuml-stdlib/C4-PlantUML)

## ➖ Drawbacks

* Automatic layout engine doesn't always do what you want it to do
* Documentation is lackluster
* Syntax seems to be all over the place
