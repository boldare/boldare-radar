# Microfrontends

> An architectural style where independently deliverable frontend applications are composed into a greater whole
>
> -- <cite>Martin Fowler</cite>

In microfrontends approach, a web application is broken up by its pages and features, with each feature being owned end-to-end by a single team. Multiple techniques exist to bring the application features‚Äîsome old and some new‚Äîtogether as a cohesive user experience, but the goal remains to allow each feature to be developed, tested and deployed independently from others.

## üëÄ TLDR;

Microfrontends helps to: split the frontend by domains, do an incremental rewrite of legacy codebase, add more independency and freedom between the teams. But the trade offs are: unmature implementations, lack of case studies and good practices, increased page load.

## ‚ûï Benefits

- **Incremental Upgrades** For many organisations this is the beginning of their micro frontends journey. The old, large, frontend monolith is being held back by yesteryear's tech stack, or by code written under delivery pressure, and it's getting to the point where a total rewrite is tempting. In order to rewrite the old application piece by piece, the microfrontend architecture sounds like a good option.
- **Technology Agnostic** Each team is be able to choose and upgrade their stack without having to coordinate with other teams.
- **Team Scalability** Multiple teams can work independently to contribute to multiple systems. This allows us to divide the work and scale it through multiple teams.
- **Single Responsibility** Each team can focus on one business domain
- **Learning Curve** For new engineers joining the teams, it is easier to learn smaller apps than understanding a monolith with thousands of lines of code.
- **Independent Deployment** Each micro frontend has its own continuous delivery pipeline, which builds, tests and deploys it all the way to production

## ‚ûñ When not to use

- when **you have doubts**. You can always start with the monolith and later migrate to the microfrontends. Despite all the benefits, microfrontends approach is quite unmature, current microfrontends implementations are not perfect - all of them have trade-offs.
- when the **team is small or have no communication problems** (eg. because of the timezone differences). In this case the question is - do you really need the independence given by microfrontends?
- when the **page load time is crucial from a business point of view**. Microfrontends will not speed up your application, the bundle will be bigger than in monolith
- when the **microfrontend applications need to communicate often each other**. The coupling between the apps should be as small as possible and when you need to share a lot of logic, then you probably should consider a monolith. The tools for a monolith are getting better and some as [Nx](https://nx.dev/) or [Turoborepo](https://turborepo.org/) are worth checking out.
- when **you don't have enough automation in place** to feasibly provision and manage the additional required infrastructure
- when **you are not comfortable with decisions around tooling and development practices becoming more decentralised** and less controllable
- when **you will not able to ensure a minimum level of quality**, consistency, or governance across your many independent frontend codebases
